/**
 A class that provides information about whether a device is connected to Internet,
 the connection type (wifi, cellular, etc), and monitors for network status changes.
 
 This is a singleton class, so use the `shared` instance to access its members.
 
 Available properties are:
 
 * **`isConnected`**: Indicates whether the device is connected to Internet or not.
 * **`connectionType`**: The connection type as a `GTNetMon.ConnectionType` value (see next).
 * **`availableConnectionTypes`**: A collection of the available connection types to the device at a given moment.
 * **`isExpensive`**: An indication that the connection is expensive while the device is connected to Internet through cellular network. Note that this flag is more accurate when used in iOS versions >= 12.0.
 * **`isMonitoring`**: It indicates whether network status changes are being monitored or not.
 
 In addition to the above, there are the following two methods:
 
 * **`startMonitoring()`**: It starts monitoring for network status changes.
 * **`stopMonitoring()`**: It stops monitoring for network status changes.
 
 **Important**
 
 1. It is recommended to start and stop monitoring in the `applicationDidBecomeActive(_:)` and `applicationWillResignActive(_:)` methods of the AppDelegate class respectively.
 2. Classes that want to be notified about monitored network status changes should observe for the **`GTNetMonNetworkStatusChangeNotification`** notification. It is posted whenever a change in the connection occurs.

 **Other**
 
 In iOS versions starting from 12.0 and above, the new `Network` framework of the iOS SDK
 is used to retrieve network information. In older iOS versions, `SCNetworkReachability` API
 is used instead.
